:: NOTES

213/ Best way to think about the "other beginning" is "by mediating along with him on this relation" between the Greek beginning and the new beginning. [why?] >> greek

218/ "Thus  it is established that  Standardization dissimulates the  very source of its own being." >> authenticity, seeming

220/ "These passages, which are crucial for my interpretation, argue that the demanding of Standardization receives its 'commission' (Schickung) from "the center of te whole illimitable relation...", the "self-dissimulating intro-play" of the Four >> authenticity, seeming, fourfold 

220/ "It is impossible to overestimage the importance, for the later H's thinking, of the notion of 'contemporaneity' (Gleichzeitigkeit)..." > time

221/ "Further and more important for my argument, H stresses that this analuysis applies to _absence_ as well as to presence." >> absence

221/ "H continues, in a passage dserving great stress: ...": there is never mere succession, but "respsecively passing-over and contemporarinety of the early and the late." Fell:"In what sense is absence the presence of a 'concealed fullness'?" >> hidden, seeming

221/ "For Heidegger what has come to be (das Gewesene) first comes to us dissimulated or veiled...", andthat is the problem with Standardization >>hidden

222/ Standardization dis-owns is source >> authenticity, hidden

0/ME: philosophy as unconcealing but in a way that leaves it concealed (not mere exposure) because of the nature of time: the origin is present. Tie to Aristotle's for the beginning is more than half of the way. Also Fell's interest in authenticity. Sartre has no concept of beginning. Tie to my own crisis.

222/Standardization is thus only the Fourfold's greatest possible self-dissimulation." >> hidden,authenticity

223/ "...appearances cannot be taken at face value but are appearanes of what does not appear." >> hidden,seeming,authenticity

225/ The Fourfold lies hidden, does not show itself at all>>hidden
