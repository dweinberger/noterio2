:: NOTES

4/ phil is "_the activity of holding oneself reflectively in a freee space_." >> phil,situated

4/ "Phil ios a movement of and towards reflection. Reflection is a state of separation or withdrawal." What's why philers are thought of as being "'out of it'".>>hidden

5/ Phil beings in Ionia, in lesiure because you need that for specualtion and "wonder">>awe

6/"...the philosopher can and should let his mind roam, because he is in a position to consider alternatives t hat seldom get considered by people who are already committed. There are all kindsof ways to get committed: tradition, family, church, fraterenities, the state, etc. Society, one might argue, conspires to get us committed." [Can phil be free of situation?]>> situated

7/to philosophize is "to affirm thinking as a self-governing region." As opposed to "Though which simply mirrors inherited opinion, or thich which reflectively utters beliefs to which one is long habituated...">> situated

8/"So long as the conclusion of one's thought is dictated in advance by some personal interest, thec onclusion of one's thought is not dictated by the thinking itself.">>situated

8/",,,toi hold one self reflectively in a free space is to attempt _distinteretsed_ thinking." But this is not uinterested: thinking aboiut something indicates that "one has some stake in thinking it">>situated

8/ "Motivationally, I believe that all thinking is in one sense a function of desire." >>situated,care

8/ Scientist can't leave himself behind, "his desire to pursue his science for whatever personal reasons he may have: money, fame, self-esteem, love of scholarship, and so forth. He does not and cannot escape the fact that certain idiosyncracies of his teperament and perhaps even certain caccidents of his upbringing may account for the fact that he is a chemist rther than a geologist..." >> situated

9/ But desire does not determine the truth. "...the fchemist is subjecting himself to disinterested conditions.">>situated,care

11/Anyone proposing a theory as a theory _about" "some part of his environemnt is also committing himself to a reflective free space." 

12/this free space is a "community of mutual respect."

12/ "...philosophy is the passionate pursuit of the dispassionate..."

16/ The other side of the coin. Play is "the most essential of human activities..because play is thec ontrolled enjoyment of a free space which under other conditions is a source of _anxiety_?

17/ "The price of a free space is that _nothing_ determines it."

17/ "Pure possibility -- which is "nothing"-- is a source of anxiety.">>possibility

20-21/Flower power is a reaction against the future and use orientation of our culture.

21/ "Where there is fact, there are no alternatives. We clash where there is freedom to differ, in the free space."

21/ We are in a clash of worldviews. "Every world-view has its ontology as well as its attitude toward time" [heidegger]

24/There is a more fundamental ontology than the instrumental one. "_who_ is it that harnesses? _What_ is it that is harnessed?"

24/Who is the harnesser? "a wibdereder, a ontemplator, the c reation of god or gods, not the master of his fate but one mstered by fate, a lover of beaty, a son of the earth."" He is a source of possibilityies, and it is there fore a betrayal of what he essentially is gto reduce him to one of his possibilities, namely narnessing or producing or mastering. Her is a source of possibilities becvause he cdan inhaboit the free-space, te space of alternatives, the space given him by language..." >>possibility

24-5/things also should be understood to be more than for our use. "A forest must first be a forest in order to be a 'national resource.' It has _possible_ uses only because it is there as something which might or might not be used. It essentially exceeds any particularuse or definition of it.">>possibility

25/ We should pay attention to the limits of our ability to define and delimit. "the fintieness of our defining"

26/ â€œa cluse to the missing common context: the clue is _possibility_.">>possiblity

26/ Requirtes humility

27/ There is no true community where one perspective conquers all others."

28/ "'to be' conveys the notion that beyond and behind what we take to be the simple fact orf the mere thing there is _more_, there are possibilities.">>possibilities, hidden

30/ Love of wisdom requires "respect for the _way_, which is reflecive and dsipassionate discourse, and rspect for the _source_, which is the common context of all oiur reflection anddiscourse.">>possibilitiy,hidden
